Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages. Modern NLP systems can perform tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation with remarkable accuracy. The development of transformer models like GPT and BERT has revolutionized the field, making it possible to create more sophisticated and context-aware language applications.
