Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the human brain's biological neural networks. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information. These networks excel at tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and complex pattern recognition. The recent advances in deep learning have made neural networks more powerful than ever, enabling breakthroughs in AI applications across various industries.
