Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. At its core, it involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. This technology powers everything from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles, making it one of the most transformative technologies of our time.
